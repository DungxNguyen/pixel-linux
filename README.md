## Assumptions

 - Already in developer mode


## Install Chromebrew

  [Chromebrew](http://skycocker.github.io/chromebrew/) is a package manager for Chrome OS which allows to easily install various tools into your Chrome OS environment. It installs directly into Chrome OS, no chroot what so ever.

    wget -q -O - https://raw.github.com/skycocker/chromebrew/master/install.sh | bash

  This gives you a decent start for working with Chrome OS on the command line, including Git support.

  Then try it out and install vim.

    crew install vim

  Yay!

## Install Chrome Dev editor

  [Chrome Dev Editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-dev-editor-develop/pnoffddplpippgcfjdhbmhkofpnaalpg) is a Chrome App which works offline and provides you a Graphical Text editor. It supports Git directly and works great together with commandline Git. I use the Monokai color theme there as this is the theme i usually have in Sublime Text too.
